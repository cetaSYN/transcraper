Use this to scrape a specific Youtuber's page for a secret code word. 

Currently, the code is set to scrape video 4 on the page. This is becase video 0-3 are projected videos for future study groups. 

I do not currently give the user a way to control which video to search. 

If others want to use this, I would love some input on how to look at specific videos.
